# go.github README

The goal of this package is to do all things in the intersection of
[Go](http://golang.org) and GitHub.  Initially this means parsing
GitHub WebHook callback data.  Let me know if there's something else
you think it should do.

## Usage

Run

    $ go run example.go

then follow the instructions.
